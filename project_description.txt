Python/matplotlib-driven TISE solver

display PD graphs (given n as input)

ideally, user specifies arbitrary one or two-dimensional barrier configuration

step 1: build for 1D inputs (start with particle-in-a-box model)
    -input length of box and quantum number n


TO DO:
------
* setup github project
